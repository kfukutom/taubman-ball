## Gist  

This program aims to create an interactive digital environment for **Taubman College students** to engage with an event that is both **digitally compelling** and **seamlessly integrated**. The system is designed for **one-on-one user interactions**, with an expected **one-night user count of approximately 300**.  

### Key Features:  
- **Database retrieval** for efficient data access  
- **Fast path searching** for optimized event navigation  
- **Filtering and querying** of user responses  
- **Modern UI** built with **AceternityUI**  

This project is **open-source**, and we welcome any contributions to improve the system further!
